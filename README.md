# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio: Pasan De Silva

## My Task

This is an even-numbered week, so I wasn't given a starter code. This week I created a web application from scratch, which will continue to be my personal portfolio as well. 

This portfolio will be used to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. It is certain that, students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp.

* There's a URL of the deployed application (github pages)

* The URL of the GitHub repository contains my code. Give the repository a unique name and include a README file that describes the project.
